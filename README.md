##22 January 2016
Lots of changes. Added code from here
https://github.com/niedzielski/pebblekit-js-require-demo
to allow the pebble-js-app code to include other files

Moved the field names into a defs file and it is shared between the pebble-js-app code and the config web page
##24 January 2016
Added require() implementation to the config page so it could use the constants defined for the phone app JS code
